        <h1>Dear Kristy,</h1>
        <p>I needed to put this into words because sometimes, emotions run too deep for me to express them out loud.</p>
        <p>Kristy, I know you’ve been through so much—whether it’s family, relationships, or the dreams you carry in your heart. I know that some wounds are hard to talk about, that even acknowledging them can hurt. But through it all, I want you to know this: I will be here, always, holding your hand.</p>
        <p>I love you. I think you know that—not just because I say it, but because I try to show you through my actions, my promises, and the way I can’t help but tell people how incredible you are. You are so strong, so unbelievably strong. And yet, you don’t always have to be. You don’t have to carry everything alone or only share your heart with God. I am here for you too. Please, don’t ever feel like you have to hide your emotions from me.</p>
        <p>Kristy, you are not a burden. You are not a disappointment. Whatever doubts or fears whisper in your mind, I need you to know this: You are beautiful inside and out. I accept you completely—the good, the bad, and everything in between. You don’t have to be afraid of judgment or rejection, and you never have to push me away. My love for you is raw, real, and unwavering.</p>
        <p>Every note, every letter, every conversation, every night spent talking, every memory we’ve made—I treasure it all. Nothing we’ve shared is meaningless to me, and nothing ever will be. Night after night, I pray for your happiness, for your safety, for your dreams to come true. You are so precious to me.</p>
        <p>If I’ve ever hurt you, I’m truly sorry. And if you’ve ever hurt me, please know that I forgive you—not because I have to, but because I understand. I know that sometimes pain makes us act in ways we don’t mean to. But no matter what, I don’t want you to feel like you have to go through things alone. Your feelings, your struggles, your fears—they all matter to me. Please, let me be the person you lean on, the person you trust with everything, even the hard things.</p>
        <p>I know that I may not always be the easiest person to talk to. I know that sometimes it’s tempting to turn elsewhere when things get overwhelming. But please, work through it with me. Even with the distance between us, I want to be the one you turn to, the one you hold onto. You mean so much to me, Kristy. Please, let’s work through everything together.</p>
        <p>No matter what, I love you. And I always, always will.</p>
        <p>Forever yours,<br>Danish</p>
